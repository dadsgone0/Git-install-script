Written in Shell and meant for Linux/MacOS ***only***. G.I.S makes installing git simple!

Step 3: Finally run `chmod u+x Git-install.sh` then run `./Git-install.sh` 
Step 4: Follow the instrutions in Terminal
Step 5: Done! you can choose to install wget if you would like too, but you dont have to.

Note: there are no dependencies you need before running this script, it will install it all for you.

Thats it! Add any features you would like by initiating a Pull Request, i may in the future make a windows version too.
